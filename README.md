# Matheus Abrahao

iOS Software Engineer

## Summary

Building and shipping native iOS applications with a focus on architecture, performance, and long-term maintainability. I write code that scales, test critical paths, and take ownership of the full product lifecycle.

Experienced in building local-first, privacy-focused applications with clean separation of concerns.

I value clear architecture, predictable code, and shipping features that hold up in production.
