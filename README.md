## About Me

Full Stack Engineer with 5+ years of experience designing, building, and operating production systems end-to-end. I specialize in React/Next.js frontends, Node.js backends, and the infrastructure to ship and scale them.

I built and operated an e-commerce platform that processed **US$90,000+ in sales**, handling everything from architecture and development to deployment and performance optimization. I work best in fast-paced, fully remote teams where ownership and product impact matter more than titles.
