## About

Full Stack Engineer with 5+ years shipping production systems. I own products end-to-end — from database schema to checkout flow to deploy pipeline.

I built and operated an e-commerce platform that generated **US$90,000+ in sales**. Not a side project. A real business with real customers, real payments, and real uptime requirements.

Currently focused on React/Next.js frontends, Node.js backends, and e-commerce systems (Shopify, headless commerce, custom integrations).

## Featured Work

### 🛒 E-commerce Platform — $90K+ Revenue

**Problem**
A retail business needed a high-converting online store with custom checkout logic, inventory sync, and room to scale.

**Solution**
Built the full stack: React/Next.js storefront, Node.js backend, Shopify integration, payment processing, and an admin dashboard for orders and inventory. Optimized for speed, SEO, and conversion.

**Impact**
- **$90,000+** in total online sales
- **40%** faster page loads after frontend optimization
- **60%** reduction in manual order processing
- **99.9%** uptime during peak traffic

## How I Work

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  → Own it end-to-end. Architecture to production.        │
│  → Ship for impact, not for show.                        │
│  → Write code that survives the next feature.            │
│  → Communicate async. Work remote. Deliver on time.      │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
